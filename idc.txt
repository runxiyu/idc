1.  Introduction

   The IDC (Internet Delay Chat) protocol is a simple binary protocol
   that allows for federated teleconferencing.

   (List concepts in subsections.)

2.  The IDC Protocol

2.1.  Overview

   The protocol as described herein is for use with both server to
   server and client to server connections.  There are, however,
   restrictions on both types of connections that the other may not
   have, as these connections have inherently different subjects.

2.2.  Messages

   Servers and clients send each other messages which usually generate a
   reply.  If the message contains a valid command, as described in
   later sections, the client SHOULD expect a reply as specified.

   Each IDC message consists of two main parts: the command, and the
   command parameters.

   The protocol messages are extracted from a contiguous stream of
   octets.  When a command sequence is followed by the correct number of
   arguments for the command, the message ends, and the very next byte
   is treated as the next command.

   <message>      ::= <command> [ <params> ]
   <command>      ::= <octet> { <octet> }
   <params>       ::= <paramlenspec> <data> [ <params> ]
   <data>         ::= <Any sequence of octets>
   <paramlenspec> ::= <A base-128 unsigned integer, where the first
                       bit of each octet indicates that the next octet
                       is still a legnth specifier (1) or is data (0),
                       and the last seven bits indicate one digit
                       in base-128.>

   Note that the NUL (00) octet is not treated specially and is valid
   data in IDC.
