Development is kind-of stalled at the moment as the authors are working
on the Evosaur Project, school, other projects, or a combination of
these.  This project isn't dropped or unmaintained---we just need a rest
and we'll pick back up on this when we feel like it.

We're still accepting suggestions and stuff, please email idc -AT-
